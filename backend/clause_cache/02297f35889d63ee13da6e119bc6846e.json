PHENOMENON  III. 0 That  the  five  primary  planets,  Mercury,  Venus,  Mars,  Jupiter,  and  Sat urn,  with  their  several  orbits,  encompass  the  sun. That  Mercury  and  Venus  revolve  about  the  sun,  is  evident  from  their moon-like  appearances.  When  they  shine  out  with  a  full  face,  they  are,  in respect  of  us,  beyond  or  above  the  sun ;  when  they  appear  half  full,  they are  about  the  same  height  on  one  side  or  other  of  the  sun ;  when  horned, they  are  below  or  between  us  and  the  sun ;  and  they  are  sometimes,  when directly  under,  seen  like  spots  traversing  the  sun's  disk.  That  Mars  sur rounds  the  sun,  is  as  plain  from  its  full  face  when  near  its  conjunction  with the  sun.  and  from  the  gibbous  figure  which  it  shews  in  its  quadratures.",
